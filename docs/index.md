# AT-TPC Machine Leaning Workflow

Hello! I am Pranjal Singh and welcome to the documentation site for the AT-TPC ML workflow. All work here is in progress and is subject to change. 

I am a fourth year PhD candidate at Michigan State University and this project is a part of my thesis work, but certainly not possible without the help of all members of the AT-TPC group and our collaborators.
