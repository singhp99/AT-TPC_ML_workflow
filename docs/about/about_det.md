In order to be able to inspect the AT-TPC data, it may be helpful to first take a look at what the AT-TPC looks like physically; this will help us understand why certain quantities would be conserved.

From the Fig. 1, we can see that this detector is cylindrical, where the beam axis is typically set as the z axis. The "active" part of the detector corresponds to a gas being used as the target, therefore this is a gaseous detector. Due to this reason, we use inverse kinematics&mdash;where the heavy particle is the beam and the lighter in a gas form inside the detector. 

For the purposes of this work, I will only be looking at data that derives from a particular experiment.
