This work would not be possible without the dedication of other AT-TPC group members and our collaborators. Additionally, I would also like to acknowledge all the contributors to the experimental data acquisition at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)&mdash;where this experiment took place.

Below is a list of all [AT-TPC](https://github.com/ATTPC) members that contributed to this project, in no particular order.

Special thanks to the [ALPhA](https://github.com/alpha-davidson) group at Davidson College for their help with the ML resources and PointNet model base.

Machine learning, and specifically training a model, requires computation resources that are not available on our personal devices. This project would not be possible without the High Performance Computational Cluster (HPCC) resources made available by the Michigan State University's [ICER](https://icer.msu.edu) group.
